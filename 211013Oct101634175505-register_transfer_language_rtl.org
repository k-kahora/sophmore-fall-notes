#+title: Register Transfer Language(RTL)
* What is RTL
It tells us how to transfer one register to another register



[[https://superuser.com/questions/1262977/open-browser-in-host-system-from-windows-subsystem-for-linux][Bruh]]

Operations executed on registers are considered micro operations

\(R2 \leftarrow R1\) This statement defines the transfer from the contents of R1 into R2
* Types of Operations
** SimpleTransfer
** Conditional Transfer
\(P_1: R2 \leftarrow R3\)

If P is one then transfer R3 to R2
** Simultaneous Operations
\(R2 \leftarrow R1, R3 \leftarrow R4\)

These happen at the same time
