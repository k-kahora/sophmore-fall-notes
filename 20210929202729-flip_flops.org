#+title: Flip Flops
* A flip flop is a an arrangement of logic gates that maintains a stable output even after the inputs are made inactive

- This also means that the output of a flip flop is determined by the
  current input and the state.  (Past history is also used)

- Flip flop is used to store a single bit of information
* Type of flip flops

- Most design work today use D flip flop
