#+title: Bus

The bus is a wire that transfers data between devices
The bus also is not like a typical wire such as point to point connectivity which either has a zero ro a 1.
A common bus wires are shared among devices.
This must be orchastrated so that conflicts dont occur when working with one wire.

* Description
The bus can only have one register loaded into it at once.  The Input devices connected to the bus are loaded from a [[id:a18a2aea-34b5-42a9-8f6f-5e7fe461f720][register]].  Using a buffer devices that disables input when OE is asserted allows control over which data can travel through the bus.
* Questions
** How many clock pulses are required to load a 4 into RegA and have RegA drive the bus
Only one clock pulse is required.
** Suppose the current state of RegA = 1011_2 and the current state of RegB = 7_16.  When RegAEnable\ and RegBEnable\ are both asserted at the same time, what values are on the bus?
Z or undefined outpu
