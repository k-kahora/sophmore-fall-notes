* Learning Objective
** Describe the sets of homogeneous and non homogeneous systems as geometric translations.
** Relate solutions sets of homogeneous and non-homogeneous systems as geometric translations of each other.
* [[id:6ddc0bf5-c1ba-4dde-8bd2-fa3611d2aba9][Homogeneous equation]]
** Ax = 0

We always have the trivial solution x - 0

The [[id:6ddc0bf5-c1ba-4dde-8bd2-fa3611d2aba9][homogeneous equation]] Ax = 0 has a non trivial soulution if and
only if the system has a [[id:ee27c1c0-e53c-444c-b2e8-66faf806aa9d][free varible]]
