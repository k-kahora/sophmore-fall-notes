#+title: kmap states

- Three states 0,1,X
- Don't care state is an X
- When does a don't care happen
  - It arises when there is a gaurentee that a value will never be generated
  - mod 5 for example has these possible outcomes (0,1,2,3,4) so other
    values we don't care :\
* Use the X in [[id:9d7b0243-e19e-49f8-bc2f-be0438023d87][Kmap]]s they allow for larger coverings which makes a more minal expression.  You don't need to cover X's though
