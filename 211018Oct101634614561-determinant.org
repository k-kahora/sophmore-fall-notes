#+title: determinant
* Determinants are for [[id:44e87b17-b0a0-48e8-b20d-7ebc93a15a33][square matrixes]]
* [[id:2d268c03-ec19-4c69-a3e1-60194f54a840][Triangular Matrix]] determinants are easy.
* Example
\(A = \begin{pmatrix} a & c \\ b & d \end{pmatrix} \)

\(A = ad-bc\)

Also no matter the size of the [[id:08dce69d-0252-4201-9f50-e864901fd373][matrix]], row replacement never changes the determinant.

However this is not the case for scaling or interchanging rows of matrices.

*Theorem:* Let A be a square matrix

If B is produced by adding a multiple of one row to another then \(detA = detB\)
If B is produced by interchanging two rows then \(detB = -detA\)
If B is produced by scaling one row to another by k then \(detB=k*detA\)

+ [[id:c10fe6c8-f263-46d0-a833-6ef17e67cab2][co-factor expansion]]
* Geometrically
A paralellgram can be defined by u and v such that the four corners are u, v, u + v, and 0
(easy to visualize with simple vectors such as)
\(u = \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}  \) and \(v = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \)
