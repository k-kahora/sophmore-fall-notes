The nature as a value reaches a very very large value beyond imagination.

* In a nut-shell
If you can find a C (Constant) that satisfy's a bound (upper, lower, exact) then that function is the behavior at the tail end of T(n)
* Types of asymptotics

O-notation is \(\geq\) or \(\leq\)
o-notion is > or <

Same for rest
