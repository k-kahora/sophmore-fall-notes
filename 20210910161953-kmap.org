#+title: Kmap

Also known as Karnaugh Map

Used to simplify Boolean Logic.

Example given a [[id:861ff439-0315-45aa-970f-ffe8ed2bcc8e][Sum of Products]] F(a,b,c) = Em(2,3,6)

| abc    | b'c = 00 | b'c = 01 | bc = 11 | bc' = 10 |
|--------+----------+----------+---------+----------|
| a' = 0 |        0 |        0 |       1 |        1 |
| a = 1  |        0 |        0 |       0 |        1 |

Formated using a [[id:316a0ab1-a0e6-4384-bf81-c0bb3a710167][grey code]]
Covering must be size of 2^n in a [[id:9d7b0243-e19e-49f8-bc2f-be0438023d87][Kmap]]

Minterm placement depends on grey code used
Order of variables is significant
* Kmap simplification
** Each one must be covered but only needs to be covered once but can be covered more than once to simplify other expressions
** Coverings are a power of 2
** Coverings CAN'T be diagonal
** Covering can connect sides and bottoms
** You can cover all four corners
** An X (don't care) does not have to be covered but can be look at [[id:185f6e21-6b8f-4e1f-9e17-f50db62ebc3e][kmap states]]
