When rebasing a certain commit hit r then i

The commit will show up and everything after it as you are editing the
entire history

When rebasing instead of committing with c c you must continue rebasing
with r r
* Merging commits
** Fixup
Only changes of a commit into a previous commit
** Squash
This saves the message of the second commit.  You can edit the
messages together

Use fixuo when you dont care about message and squash when you do care
