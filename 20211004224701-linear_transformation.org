#+title: Linear Transformation
* Transformation
A fancy term for a function
Take a [[id:4180700c-adde-43ae-9fef-251975521d8e][Vectors]] and output a [[id:4180700c-adde-43ae-9fef-251975521d8e][Vector]]
Transformation implies movement
When thinking of a transformation of Vectors thin of points.
Maybe think about the gird in 2 dimensions
* Linear
- All lines must remain lines without getting curved and the orgin
  must stay in place.
- Parallel and evenly spaced
* Examples
- \(\vec{v} = -1\hat{i} + 2\hat{j}\) 
- Transformed \(\vec{v}\) \(= -1(\) Transformed \( \hat{i}) + \) \(2(\) Transformed \( \hat{i})\)
- \(=-1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} + 2 \begin{bmatrix} 3
  \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \) this is assuming the transformation moved the
  [[id:121c6ed6-35a4-4cc6-8ebc-cdee513330bc][basis]] Vectors to those positions
