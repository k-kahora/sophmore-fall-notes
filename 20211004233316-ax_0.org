#+title: Ax = 0

Ax = 0 is always solvable threes always the [[id:75166794-370e-4a59-81cf-01189a2d1893][trivial solution]] 0.

This means were interested in the non trivial solutions.

Thus the Homogeneous System Ax = 0 has non trivial solutions if and
only if the system has [[id:5889cde1-0a54-4012-be98-6e5b601b69eb][free variable]].
