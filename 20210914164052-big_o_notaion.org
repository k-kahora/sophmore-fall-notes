#+title: big O notation


* Formal definition
- \(f(n) = O(g(n)) \) if there are positive constants \(n_0\) and
  \(c\)  such that to the right of \(n_0\), the value of \(f(n)\)
  always lies on or above \(c * g(n)\)

  A tight upper bound means there are functions which are below the current upperbound that still satisfy O(f(n))
