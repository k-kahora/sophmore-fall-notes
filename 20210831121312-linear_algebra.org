** System of linear eqautions
*** A linear system is is a collection of linear equations.  A [[id:08dce69d-0252-4201-9f50-e864901fd373][matrix]] is n array of numbers which represents the information of a linear system.  For example

| 1 | -2 |  1 |  0  |
| 0 |  2 | -8 |  8  |
| 0 |  5 | -5 | 10 |

Solving a linear system using [[id:ba30bf29-53ba-4a8f-bbe5-4ae1c37c3988][Gaussian Elimination]]

Solved using the matrixes which is much better then a cumbersonme
approach using a system of equations.  [[id:f022aa49-51d5-4c67-952d-13c4c8d2ca2b][elementary row operations]]
