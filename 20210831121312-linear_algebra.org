** System of linear eqautions
*** A linear system is is a collection of linear equations.  A [[id:08dce69d-0252-4201-9f50-e864901fd373][matrix]] is n array of numbers which represents the information of a linear system.  For example

| 1 | -2 |  1 |  0  |
| 0 |  2 | -8 |  8  |
| 0 |  5 | -5 | 10 |

Solving a linear system using [[id:ba30bf29-53ba-4a8f-bbe5-4ae1c37c3988][Gaussian Elimination]]

Solved using the matrixes which is much better then a cumbersonme
approach using a system of equations.  [[id:f022aa49-51d5-4c67-952d-13c4c8d2ca2b][elementary row operations]]

** Learning Objectives

*** Transform amatrix into [[id:04061155-3cb2-4802-bd96-869fa1904bea][echelon]] or reduced [[id:04061155-3cb2-4802-bd96-869fa1904bea][echelon]] form.

*** Use pivots and free varibles to deduce information about existence and uniqueness of solutions of the linear system.

** Forward phase: word down the matrix creating 0s below certain entries

** Backward phase: work back up the matrix creating 0s above certain entries

** Pivots and free varibles

*** The entries corresponding to leading  1s in reduced row [[id:04061155-3cb2-4802-bd96-869fa1904bea][echelon]] form are called pivots.

*** The columns with pivot positions are called pivot columns

** Revisiting existence and uniqueness

*** Is the system consistent? That is, does there exist at least one soulution? If a soulution exists, is it unique
