#+title: echelon

A aspect of [[id:7f212453-f8f6-4753-9451-796941ad524b][Linear Algebra]] for solving matrixes

Echelon form is the following

* Any rows of all zeros are at the bottom of the matrix
* Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above
* All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros.

A matrix that is already in echelon form is in reduced echelon form if
* The leading entry in each non-zero row is 1
* Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in the column
