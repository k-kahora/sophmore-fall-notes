Notes

Why do we study Algorithims.  They help us understand Scalibiliy

Helps draw the line between what is feasible and what is impossible

Performance is the currency of computers limited amount.

It also helps us understand better using a common language.

Anaysis is commonly donr on [[id:5c6ab6fd-fab9-4662-92f2-55ec29918af6][Sorting]] programs

** Maximum time given size n

* Average Case

** Average time given size n

* Best Case 

** Works for some specific inpit not intresting for complexity

* Sign notation
