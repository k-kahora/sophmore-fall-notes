#+title: org souce blocks
* Org source blocks
use the header argument -n to display lines and +n to display lines
numbers from previous block

use -r to tell org you want to use tagging feature make a tag on a
line with (org-store-link)

refrence this tag with C-c C-l

#+begin_src matlab
  
  M = [1, 2, 4 , 5];
  
  x = 1 : 0.1 : 3;                                                  (ref:vectorx)
  
  rref(M);
  
#+end_src

Look at line [[(vectorx)][refrence to vector x]]

This only works when you open the code block with C-c '

use C-c C-l to insert link also make sure -n is used
